Health checks for building services
===

This project is part of ASP.NET Core, as an initial out-of-band library.
There are plans to include this library in ASP.NET Core vNext (probably ASP.NET Core 2.1, but still TBD).

As of 2018-Feb-28, Microsoft.AspNetCore.HealthChecks and Microsoft.Extensions.HealthChecks.SqlServer are available from the nuget gallery, but they have only been released for .NETCoreApp 1.0 and they were not released by the core developers.

[Follow nuget](https://www.nuget.org/packages?q=Microsoft.Extensions.HealthChecks+Microsoft.AspNetCore.HealthChecks+Microsoft.Extensions.HealthChecks.SqlServer) for details.
